            laws of the United States or other countries, including the country in which you are resident or
            from which you use the Services. You affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the Services are
            not intended for children under 13.</p>

            <p><strong style={{textTransform: "uppercase"}}>Availability, Errors and Inaccuracies</strong></p>
            <p>We are constantly updating product and service offerings on the Service. However, from time
            to time there may be delays in updating information on the Service and in our advertising on
            other websites. There may be instances where information regarding our prices and products
            on our website is not complete or current. We cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness
            of any information found on the Service and we therefore reserve the right to change or update
            information and to correct errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time without prior notice.</p>

            <p><strong style={{textTransform: "uppercase"}}>Contests, Sweepstakes and Promotions</strong></p>
            <p>Any contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions (collectively, "Promotions") made available
            through the Service may be governed by rules that are separate from these Terms and
            Conditions. If you participate in any Promotions, please review the applicable rules as well as
            our Privacy Policy. If the rules for a Promotion conflict with these Terms and Conditions, the
            Promotion rules will apply.</p>

            <p><strong style={{textTransform: "uppercase"}}>Subscriptions</strong></p>
            <p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed
            in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set to bill on a
            monthly or annual basis depending on the type of subscription plan a user selects when
            purchasing a Subscription. At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically
            renew under the same conditions unless: (1) The user who created the Subscription cancels it
            or (2) Fulfill cancels the Subscription. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through
            your online account management page or by contacting Fulfill’s customer support team.</p>

            <p><strong style={{textTransform: "uppercase"}}>Subscription Payment</strong></p>
            <p>You must provide Fulfill with accurate and complete billing information including full name,
            address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information to
            purchase any Service or Product offered by Fulfill. For the purposes of these Terms, a valid
            payment method is limited to credit card, and debit cards. By submitting such payment
            information, you automatically authorize Fulfill to charge all Subscription fees incurred through
            your account to any such payment instruments. Should automatic billing fail to occur for any
            reason, Fulfill will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within
            a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated
            on the invoice. If you fail to make payment within the specified time, your subscription will be
            terminated.</p>

            <p><strong style={{textTransform: "uppercase"}}>Overdue Payment</strong></p>
            <p>Any payment not received from Retailer by the due date may accrue (except with respect to
            charges then under reasonable and good faith dispute), at Fulfull’s discretion, late charges at
            the rate of 1.0% of the outstanding balance per month (12.67% per annum), or the maximum
            rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, from the date such payment was due until the date
            paid.</p>

            <p><strong style={{textTransform: "uppercase"}}>Free Trial</strong></p>
            <p>Fulfill may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time
            ("Free Trial"). You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the
            Free Trial. See above section “Subscription Payment” for billing information requirements.
            If you enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged
            by Fulfill until the Free Trial has expired. If you fail to cancel your Subscription before 11:59PM
            on the day your Free Trial is set to expire, you will be automatically charged the applicable
            Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected. At any time and without
            notice, Fulfill reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or
            (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.</p>

            <p><strong style={{textTransform: "uppercase"}}>Fee Changes</strong></p>
            <p>Fulfill, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the
            Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current
            Billing Cycle. Fulfill will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription
            fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes
            effective. Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect
            constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>

            <p><strong style={{textTransform: "uppercase"}}>Refunds</strong></p>
            <p>Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by Fulfill on a case-by-case basis
            and granted in sole discretion of Fulfill. Refunds for delayed packages will be granted in the sole
            discretion of Fulfill and proof of refund is required for consideration.</p>

            <p><strong style={{textTransform: "uppercase"}}>Accounts</strong></p>
            <p>When you create an account with us, you guarantee that you are above the age of 18, and that
            all information you provide to us is accurate, complete, and current at all times. Inaccurate,
            incomplete, or obsolete information may result in the immediate termination of your account

            with our Service or a third-party service. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware
            of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.
            You may not use as a username the name of another person or entity or that is not lawfully
            available for use, a name or trademark that is subject to any rights of another person or entity
            other than you, without appropriate authorization, or any username that is otherwise
            misleading. You may not use as a username any name that is offensive, vulgar or obscene.
            We reserve the all rights to refuse service to any individual or company user, to terminate
            accounts, to remove or edit content, or to cancel orders in our sole discretion and without
            explanation.</p>

            <p>Our Service may contain links to third party web sites or services that are not owned or
            controlled by Fulfill. Fulfill has no control over and assumes no responsibility for the content,

            <p>
            You agree that Fulfill may terminate or suspend your account and bar access to the Service
            immediately, without prior notice or liability, under our sole discretion, for any reason
            whatsoever and without limitation, including but not limited to a breach of the Terms.
            If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the Service. No
            refunds or credits for subscription charges will be provided to you, should you choose to
            terminate your subscription or cancel your account prior to the end of your effective
            subscription term.</p>

            <p>OR</p>

            <p>The obligations and liabilities of the parties incurred prior to the termination date shall survive
            the termination of this agreement for all purposes. These Terms of Service are effective unless
            and until terminated by either you or us. You may terminate these Terms of Service at any time
            by notifying us that you no longer wish to use our Services, or when you cease using our site.

                <ol type="a">
                    <li><strong>Contract between Retailer and Supplier.</strong> Where Retailer submits a Retailer Order through the
                    Fulfill Platform for Products listed as available, Retailer and Supplier are entering into a legally
                    binding agreement under which Supplier agrees to Dropship the Products to the specified End
                    User at the Listed Price, plus applicable transaction fees, taxes and Shipping Fees. Such
                    agreement shall incorporate the minimum terms set out below and such other lawful and
                    non-conflicting terms as may be set out in Supplier’s Supplier Profile at the time of the Retailer
                    Order. FULFILL IS NOT PART OF, AND HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY IN RESPECT OF, ANY
                    SUCH CONTRACT.</li>
                    <li><strong>Return Policy.</strong> Each Supplier’s return policy is set out in the applicable Supplier Profile. Fulfill will
                    work with Retailer in good faith in respect of enforcing such return policy. FULFILL HAS NO
                    CONTROL OVER THE ACTIONS OF SUPPLIERS AND ACCEPTS NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY IN

                    <li><strong>No marketing materials.</strong> When shipping Fulfill orders, each Supplier agrees that it will not
                    include any marketing or promotional material such as coupons/gift certificates that encourage
                    the End Customer to buy directly from Supplier’s website or otherwise seeks to divert business
                    away from Retailer or Fulfill. Each Supplier agrees that only the invoice provided by Fulfill will be
                    included in Fulfill order packages. This invoice is made available to Supplier with every Retailer
                    Order through the Fulfill Platform. FULFILL HAS NO CONTROL OVER THE ACTIONS OF SUPPLIERS
                    AND ACCEPTS NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY IN THE EVENT OF A BREACH BY SUPPLIER OF ITS

                    <li><strong>Processing times.</strong> Supplier must indicate its processing times as well as delivery times on the
                    Supplier Profile. "Processing time" is the number of business days to ship and provide tracking

                    after it is shipped. If the orders are processed late, Retailer may cancel the Retailer Order
                    through the Fulfill Platform and Fulfill will process a refund from Supplier to Retailer. FULFILL
                    HAS NO CONTROL OVER THE ACTIONS OF SUPPLIERS AND ACCEPTS NO RESPONSIBILITY OR
                    LIABILITY IN THE EVENT OF A BREACH BY SUPPLIER OF ITS OBLIGATIONS.</li>

                    processed in accordance with “Fees and Payment”</li>
                    <li><strong>Disclaimer of responsibility.</strong> FULFILL DOES NOT PROCESS ANY RETAILER ORDERS, IT MERELY
                    FACILITATES COMMUNICATION AND CONTRACT BETWEEN RETAILER AND SUPPLIERS.
                    ACCORDINGLY, WHILE FULFILL WITH RETAILER AND SUPPLIERS TO RESOLVE ANY ISSUES THAT
                    MAY ARISE, FULFILL EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PROCESSING
